<!-- ## Design Numbers

- How big of a battery can be fitted into the system

- Is there a maximum cost?

- How long must the device work off a battery?

- System average current

- What parts are expected to be used and how much current do they consume?
	|Part| State(on)|State(Sleep)|










## Engineering Numbers

- What are the different states the device can be in?
	- On
	- Sleep
	- 
- How much time will the device spend in each state?
	|State|Time(seconds)|% of total time in state|
	|-----|-------------|------------------------|
	On|5|1%|
	Sleep|300|99%|


- How much current is used in each state?
	|State| Current(mA)|
	|-----|------------|
	|On|1|
	|Sleep|1|


- How long will the device last given a battery of capacity:________?
	- Capacity of battery: __ mAh

	Power used in
	|State|Power used in state(mA * proportion of total time spent in mode)
	|-----|-------------------|
	|On| 3939393|
	|Sleep|21232| -->
